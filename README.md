# FIXED
  
  I wrote wrong version 
  but I fixed 

# str2hex

this script is for String to hex encode,
  
  ./str2hex.py "word for encode"
  
this is for my playing so maybe will occure some error,
because I didn't test in other environment
  
  
  
# Example
  
    "/bin" -> 0x6e69622f or \x6e\x69\x62\x2f
  
# Shellcode generate
  
    option "--shellcode" -> generate the shellcode for 32bit and 64bit
           however these are generated by ragg2
